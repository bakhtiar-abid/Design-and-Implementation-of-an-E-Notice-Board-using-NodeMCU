# Design-and-Implementation-of-an-E-Notice-Board-using-NodeMCU
Wireless electronic notice boards are a faster alter-native to conven-
tional pin-up type notice boards. In this paper, the development of simple and

low-cost Android based wireless notice board is presented. A prism shaped de-
vice, having a portable circuit inside and an LCD display outside, is a solution

for displaying any messages or notices immediately. A user can type a message
in the app and the message will be displayed in the notice board instantly. It is a
convenient substitute for traditional noticeboard where written papers are pinned
in a board. Other than institutional purposes, the same technology can be used in
traffic signals, railway stations, bus stands, shopping malls and in every public
place where people can get messages or emergency alert. The wireless notice
board display is configured using NodeMCU, 16x02 LCD Display, I2C Adapter
for 16x02 LCD Display, Buzzer, Mini Breadboard, Jumper Wires and PVC
Boards. As the electronic notice board is wireless so it minimizes the hassles of
wires as well as it is very easy to operate and consumes less power.
